[content]
We are looking for motivated individuals whose presence will be beneficial to overall lab productivity. Lab members are expected to participate and contribute in group efforts as well as being capable of working independently towards personal and lab goals. Members must be able to quickly learn the concept of experimental design, data collection, and analysis. Programming experience is not necessary but would be extremely beneficial as it is essential for this line of research.
Applications should be sent to nathan.spreng[at]mcgill[dot]ca with the following information:
- Your CV
- Recent academic transcript
- A letter detailing your specific interests, intentions, and capabilities
The subject header should read “LBC Undergraduate Volunteer Inquiry”.

Graduate students are encouraged to contact nathan.spreng[at]mcgill[dot]ca to express their interest in working in the lab. Here is some advice for prospective students:
- Contact Dr. Spreng in the early Fall before the application deadline. Most decisions are made in Winter regarding incoming students. 
- Experience in functional neuroimaging analysis is a plus that will distinguish top candidates. Be sure to do your best to become involved in research during your undergraduate degree or immediately following.
- Familiarity with coding (e.g., MATLAB and/or Python, R) is a strong asset.
- You will be applying to the McGill University Integrated Program in Neuroscience. See their website for requirements and deadlines.
- Make sure to apply for government sources of funding for your graduate studies (NSERC or CIHR if you are Canadian). Deadlines are often in the Fall, a year before graduate studies begin.
- Grades are very important both in getting funding, as well as in decisions for admission — so make sure to get as good grades as possible in your remaining courses.
- Letters of recommendation are very important. Make sure to ask recommenders who not only have good things to say about you, but also know you enough to be able to provide detail in their letters about you. 

Post-doctoral candidates are also encouraged to contact Dr. Nathan Spreng directly nathan.spreng[at]mcgill[dot]ca.
